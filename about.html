                <h3>How do travel agents get paid, and will it cost me extra?</h3>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Great question! Travel agents are typically paid by the resorts, so we don't charge a service fee for our expertise. 
                    Many resorts follow price parity, meaning the cost is the same whether you book through us, directly with the resort, or via an online booking site.
